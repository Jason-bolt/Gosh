            <h5><strong>Can payment be made through the site?</strong></h5>
            <p class="mb-5">
                Not at the moment. According to our current
                <a href="terms.html">Terms & Conditions</a>, we do not take in any
                form of payment. Hence payments for services rendered must be done
                directly between the provider and recipient.
            </p>

            <h5><strong>How do I report a foul play?</strong></h5>
            <p class="mb-5">
                We advice interested customers to be very cautious in making payments
                to any business owner. However, unforseen circumstances may occur. At
                the moment, only business owners can be held accountable since they
                are the only ones registered on this platform. As such customers can
                report businesses that take monies without delivering expected reuslts
                by sending us a message or calling so that the said business will be
                taking off.
